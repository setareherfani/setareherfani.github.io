In mid-2019, after years of studying Psychology and Cognitive Science, my passion for data analytics and machine learning carried me through 12 weeks of intense studies that were rewarded with a Diploma in Data Science and certifications from Data Science, Machine Learning, and iOS Development courses on Coursera and Udemy. This, in due course, satisfied my passion for digging into health data and coming up with solutions to help people live in a better world.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Health Sciences, a Diploma in Data Science from BrainStation Toronto. I am also currently on a journey to become an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.
